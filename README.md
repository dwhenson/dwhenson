# Hey, I’m Dave. 👋
***I love building fast, easy-to-use and accessible websites.***

A frontend developer with a strong focus on accessible HTML, modern CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. As a mid-career changer, I seek an opportunity to apply the skills I've learnt independently in a real-world, professional setting. I am looking for a position where I can learn from others, further establish my solid technical foundations, and develop the habits that will help me grow as a competent developer.

  
## 🪴 I’m currently learning:

- React (I don't really love it, yet...)
- Advacned SCSS (hmmm, I'm not sure I'd actually use much of this!)
- Testing (hoping it will save me a lot of pain in the future)

## Contact 📫 

Email is the [best way to reach me](mailto:dave.henson@gmail.com). I'd love to give you all my social media connections, but I'm not really into all that, so I'm afraid you'll just have to write.
