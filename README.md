# Hey, I’m Dave. 👋
***I love building fast, easy-to-use and accessible websites.***

I’m a frontend developer with a strong focus on accessible HTML, modern CSS and vanilla JavaScript. I also have experience with static site generators. At the moment I am increasing my knowledge of website performance and and how browsers work, while dipping my toes into UX and UI design.

I have plenty of experience working with remote teams. I aim to transition into a frontend developer role over the next year or so. I’m looking for my next opportunity as a frontend web developer starting in 2022. Please do get in touch; I'd love to hear about what you are working on and if I could help.
  
  
## 🪴 I’m currently learning:

- Static Site Generators (Eleventy)
- Service workers
- Re-doing basic JS (again)

## Contact 📫 

Email is the [best way to reach me](mailto:dave.henson@gmail.com). I'd love to give you all my social media connections, but I'm not really into all that and I don't have any, so I'm afraid you'll just have to write.
